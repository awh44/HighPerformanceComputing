# HighPerformanceComputing
This repository contains homework assignments for a High Performance Computing course. The homework questions can be seen
in the syllabus provided here in the root directory. Each individual homework is contained in its own directory. Within each
directory, if the professor for the course provided code, this code is contained within a `code/` subdirectory. This subdirectory
will also contain any modifications to that code, including compilations of it to assembly, in cases where appropriate. Any
changes to the original code or generated assembly should be traceable through the commit history.

Note that although there are homeworks listed as "hw5" and "hw8," there aren't actually any missing homeworks. The homework
numbers correspond to the week they were due, as shown in the syllabus.
